Add inline-comments to rules. Lookup rule documentation online.

Some LSPs provide code actions for to do that â€“ this plugin adds commands for linters and LSPs that don't.

## Features
- Add inline-comments that ignore diagnostic rules.
- Location of the ignore comment, like next line or previous line, is configurable.
- Perform a web search for a diagnostic rule.
- Requires diagnostics provided by a source that supports neovim's builtin diagnostics system (`vim.diagnostic`). nvim's builtin LSP client and [nvim-lint](https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-lint) are such sources.

## Supported Sources
You easily add a custom source via the [plugin configuration](#configuration). However, please consider making a PR to add support for a linter if it is missing.

[Ignore Rule Data for the supported linters](./lua/rulebook/ignoreRuleData.lua)

### For adding ignore comments
<!-- TODO: auto-generate this list -->
- selene
- shellcheck
- vale
- yamllint
- stylelint
- LTeX
- typescript
- pylint

### For looking up rule documentation
- selene
- shellcheck
- pylint

## Installation

```lua
-- lazy.nvim
{
	"chrisgrieser/nvim-rulebook",
	keys = {
		{ "<leader>i", function() require("rulebook").ignoreRule() end },
		{ "<leader>l", function() require("rulebook").lookupRule() end },
	}
},
```

```lua
-- packer
use { "chrisgrieser/nvim-rulebook" }

-- in your config
vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>i", function() require("rulebook").ignoreRule() end)
vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>l", function() require("rulebook").lookupRule() end)
```

## Configuration

```lua
defaultConfig = {
	ignoreRuleComments = {
		selene = {
			comment = "-- selene: allow(%s)",
			location = "prevLine",
		},
		-- ... (full list of supported sources can be found in the README)

		yourCustomSource = {
			-- %s will be replaced with rule-id
			-- if location is "encloseLine", needs to be a list of two strings
			comment = "// disabling-comment %s",

			-- "prevLine"|"sameLine"|"encloseLine"
			location = "prevLine",
		}
	},

	-- %s will be replaced with rule-id
	ruleDocumentations = {
		selene = "https://kampfkarren.github.io/selene/lints/%s.html"
		-- ... (full list of supported sources can be found in the README)

		yourCustomSource = "https://my-docs/%s.hthml"

		-- Search URL when no documentation definition is available for a
		-- diagnostic source. "%s" will be replaced with the diagnostic source & code.
		-- Default is the DDG "Ducky Search" (automatically opening first result).
		fallback = "https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%s+%21ducky&kl=en-us",
	}
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> The plugin uses `vim.ui.select()`, so the appearance of the rule selection can be customized by using a ui-plugin like [dressing.nvim](https://github.com/stevearc/dressing.nvim).

## Limitations
- The diagnostics have to contain the necessary data, [that is a diagnostic code and diagnostic source](https://neovim.io/doc/user/diagnostic.html#diagnostic-structure). Most LSPs and most linters configured for `nvim-lint` do that, but some diagnostic sources do not (for example `efm-langserver` with incorrectly defined errorformat). Please open an issue at the diagnostics provider to fix.
- This plugin does *not* hook into `vim.lsp.buf.code_action`, but provides its own independent selector.
- As opposed to [null-ls](https://github.com/jose-elias-alvarez/null-ls.nvim)'s code action feature, this plugin does not support arbitrary code actions, but only actions based on a diagnostic.
